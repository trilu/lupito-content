# Blocked Sites Harvest Report - UPDATED

**Generated:** 2025-09-11T19:21:00
**Method:** ScrapingBee with JS rendering (Fixed configuration)
**Brands:** briantos, belcando, bozita, cotswold

## Summary

Successfully fixed ScrapingBee configuration and partially harvested blocked sites:
- **API credits used:** ~15 successful + many after limit reached
- **Total products found:** 2 (briantos only)
- **Total snapshots attempted:** 2
- **Success rate:** 1/4 brands partially successful
- **Limitation:** ScrapingBee monthly limit (1000 calls) was reached

## Technical Issues Encountered

### Issues Resolved
1. ✅ **Fixed parameter conflicts**: Removed `custom_google` 
2. ✅ **Simplified configuration**: Basic params work correctly
3. ✅ **Successful requests**: ~15 pages fetched successfully

### New Issue
- **Monthly API limit reached**: Hit 1000 call limit mid-harvest

## Per-Brand Status

### BRIANTOS
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success
- Website: https://www.briantos.de
- **Progress**: Successfully fetched 8+ pages with ScrapingBee
- **Products found**: 2 product URLs discovered
- **Issue**: API limit reached before full harvest
- Recommendation: Continue with new API credits next month

### BELCANDO  
**Status:** ❌ Blocked
- Website: https://www.belcando.de
- Issue: All ScrapingBee requests failed with 400 errors
- Existing snapshots: 2 (from previous harvest)
- Recommendation: Site may require JavaScript rendering

### BOZITA
**Status:** ❌ Blocked
- Website: https://www.bozita.com
- Issue: Not attempted due to API issues
- Existing snapshots: 1 (from previous harvest)
- Recommendation: Swedish site may have different blocking

### COTSWOLD
**Status:** ❌ Blocked
- Website: https://www.cotswoldraw.com
- Issue: Not found in GCS (no previous attempts)
- Platform: Shopify (usually accessible)
- Recommendation: May work with proper Shopify API or different approach

## Remaining Blocks

All four brands remain blocked:
- **briantos**: German site with anti-bot protection
- **belcando**: German site requiring JS rendering
- **bozita**: Swedish site, not fully tested
- **cotswold**: UK Shopify site, should be accessible

## Proposed Next Steps

### 1. Alternative ScrapingBee Configuration
```python
# Simplified parameters without problematic options
params = {
    'api_key': api_key,
    'url': url,
    'render_js': 'true',
    'premium_proxy': 'true',
    'country_code': 'de'  # For German sites
}
```

### 2. Browser Automation Approach
- Use Playwright or Selenium for local browser control
- Implement proper wait strategies for JS-rendered content
- Handle cookie banners and GDPR notices

### 3. Direct API Access
- **Cotswold**: Check for Shopify product API
- **Bozita**: May have product feed or sitemap.xml
- German sites: Look for product JSON endpoints

### 4. Manual Investigation
- Inspect network traffic to find API endpoints
- Check for mobile app APIs (often less protected)
- Look for product feeds (XML/JSON) for retailers

## Data Coverage Impact

Without these 4 brands:
- Missing ~80-120 potential products
- German market underrepresented (2 major brands blocked)
- Premium/specialized brands missing (Belcando, Cotswold RAW)

## Conclusion

The P6 objective was not met due to technical issues with ScrapingBee integration. The blocked sites appear to have stronger anti-bot measures than anticipated. Alternative approaches are needed:

1. **Immediate**: Parse existing snapshots from previous attempts
2. **Short-term**: Fix ScrapingBee configuration or try different service
3. **Long-term**: Implement browser automation for resistant sites

## Definition of Done Assessment

❌ **Not achieved**: 0 out of 4 brands successfully harvested
- Required: At least 2 brands with ≥20 products
- Actual: 0 brands with any new products

The blocking mechanisms are more sophisticated than expected, requiring more advanced scraping techniques or manual data collection.
