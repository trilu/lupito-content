Some breeds can be aloof with everyone but their owner, while other breeds treat everyone they know like their best friend.Good With Young ChildrenNot RecommendedGood With ChildrenA breed's level of tolerance and patience with childrens' behavior, and overall family-friendly nature. Dogs should always be supervised around young children, or children of any age who have little exposure to dogs.Good With Other DogsNot RecommendedGood With Other DogsHow generally friendly a breed is towards other dogs. Dogs should always be supervised for interactions and introductions with other dogs, but some breeds are innately more likely to get along with other dogs, both at home and in public.Shedding LevelNo SheddingHair EverywhereHow much fur and hair you can expect the breed to leave behind. Breeds with high shedding will need to be brushed more frequently, are more likely to trigger certain types of allergies, and are more likely to require more consistent vacuuming and lint-rolling.Coat Grooming FrequencyMonthlyDailyHow frequently a breed requires bathing, brushing, trimming, or other kinds of coat maintenance. Consider how much time, patience, and budget you have for this type of care when looking at the grooming effort needed. All breeds require regular nail trimming.Drooling LevelLess Likely to DroolAlways Have a TowelHow drool-prone a breed tends to be. If you're a neat freak, dogs that can leave ropes of slobber on your arm or big wet spots on your clothes may not be the right choice for you.Coat TypeWiryHairlessSmoothRoughCordedDoubleCurlyWavySilkyCanine coats come in many different types, depending on the breed's purpose. Each coat type comes with different grooming needs, allergen potential, and shedding level.

Some long-haired breeds can be trimmed short, but this will require additional upkeep to maintain.Openness To StrangersReservedEveryone Is My Best FriendHow welcoming a breed is likely to be towards strangers. Some breeds will be reserved or cautious around all strangers, regardless of the location, while other breeds will be happy to meet a new human whenever one is around!Playfulness LevelOnly When You Want To PlayNon-StopHow enthusiastic about play a breed is likely to be, even past the age of puppyhood. Some breeds will continue wanting to play tug-of-war or fetch well into their adult years, while others will be happy to just relax on the couch with you most of the time.Watchdog/Protective NatureWhat's Mine Is YoursVigilantA breed's tendency to alert you that strangers are around.

High energy breeds are ready to go and eager for their next adventure. They'll spend their time running, jumping, and playing throughout the day.

While some breeds will bark at every passer-by or bird in the window, others will only bark in particular situations. Some barkless breeds can still be vocal, using other sounds to express themselves.Mental Stimulation NeedsHappy to LoungeNeeds a Job or ActivityHow much mental stimulation a breed needs to stay happy and healthy. Purpose-bred dogs can have jobs that require decision-making, problem-solving, concentration, or other qualities, and without the brain exercise they need, they'll create their own projects to keep their minds busy -- and they probably won't be the kind of projects you'd like.Affectionate With FamilyIndependentLovey-DoveyHow affectionate a breed is likely to be with family members, or other people he knows well.

They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.\nThe Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a 'merry action.'\n\n\n\n The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.\n\n\n\n Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.Read MoreNational Breed Club & RescueWant to connect with other people who love the same breed as much as you do?

The Golden's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.Recommended Health Tests From the National Breed Club:Hip EvaluationElbow EvaluationCardiac ExamOphthalmologist EvaluationNeuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis 5 (Golden Retriever) (NCL, NCL5) - DNA TestRead the Official Breed Club Health Club StatementADVERTISEMENTDifferent breeds have different needs.

Most of the time, a good brushing-out with a slicker brush once or twice a week will remove much of the dead hair before it has a chance to fall onto the furniture. During times of heavy shedding, these brushing sessions turn into daily affairs. Baths help to loosen the dead hairs, but the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins. Otherwise, Goldens only need occasional baths to keep them clean. As with all breeds, the Golden's nails should be trimmed regularly.Stay Up-To-Date About Dog GroomingGet dog health information conveniently delivered to your inbox each weekEMAIL ADDRESSSIGN UPVIEW ALL THE CHOICES FOR AKC NEWSLETTERS TO RECEIVE THE CONTENT YOU WANT >AKC Privacy PolicyExerciseLike most Sporting breeds, Goldens need plenty of daily exercise. A Golden who doesn't get enough exercise is likely to engage in undesirable behavior. Goldens make great companions on long runs and bike rides, although consultation with a vet is recommended before starting strenuous or high-impact activities that might cause stress to the dog's bones and joints. Many Goldens happily get their exercise on hunting trips or at field trials, as well as by participating in canine sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking.Stay Up-To-Date About Dog Exercise and ActivitiesGet dog health information conveniently delivered to your inbox each weekEMAIL ADDRESSSIGN UPVIEW ALL THE CHOICES FOR AKC NEWSLETTERS TO RECEIVE THE CONTENT YOU WANT >AKC Privacy PolicyTrainingAs with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of seven weeks and four months will help the Golden develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process and help the owner learn to recognize and correct any bad habits that may be developing. Obedience training strengthens the bond between dog and owner'a Golden wants nothing more than to please his human. Golden Retrievers are outgoing, loyal, and eager to do your bidding, which makes them very easy to train.Stay Up-To-Date About Dog TrainingGet dog health information conveniently delivered to your inbox each weekEMAIL ADDRESSSIGN UPVIEW ALL THE CHOICES FOR AKC NEWSLETTERS TO RECEIVE THE CONTENT YOU WANT >AKC Privacy PolicyNutritionA high-quality dog food appropriate for the dog's age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the breed needs. Some Goldens can become overweight, so watch your dog's calorie consumption and weight level. If you choose to give your dog treats, do so in moderation. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not.

They are serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not at work.\\nThe Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a 'merry action.'\\n\\n\\n\\n The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth's great-nephew, the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor. They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.\\n\\n\\n\\n Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.Read MoreNational Breed Club & RescueWant to connect with other people who love the same breed as much as you do?

When you take a dog into your life, you need to understand the commitment that dog ownership entails.HealthGoldens are generally healthy dogs, and responsible breeders will screen their breeding stock for health conditions including elbow and hip dysplasia; eye conditions such as juvenile cataracts, pigmentary uveitis, and progressive retinal atrophy; and certain heart diseases, including subvalvular aortic stenosis. The Golden's ears should be checked weekly for signs of infection, and the teeth should be brushed often.Recommended Health Tests From the National Breed Club:Hip EvaluationElbow EvaluationCardiac ExamOphthalmologist EvaluationNeuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis 5 (Golden Retriever) (NCL, NCL5) - DNA TestRead the Official Breed Club Health Club StatementADVERTISEMENTDifferent breeds have different needs.

Most of the time, a good brushing-out with a slicker brush once or twice a week will remove much of the dead hair before it has a chance to fall onto the furniture. During times of heavy shedding, these brushing sessions turn into daily affairs. Baths help to loosen the dead hairs, but the dog must be completely dry before brushing begins. Otherwise, Goldens only need occasional baths to keep them clean. As with all breeds, the Golden's nails should be trimmed regularly.Stay Up-To-Date About Dog GroomingGet dog health information conveniently delivered to your inbox each weekEMAIL ADDRESSSIGN UPVIEW ALL THE CHOICES FOR AKC NEWSLETTERS TO RECEIVE THE CONTENT YOU WANT >AKC Privacy PolicyExerciseLike most Sporting breeds, Goldens need plenty of daily exercise. A Golden who doesn't get enough exercise is likely to engage in undesirable behavior. Goldens make great companions on long runs and bike rides, although consultation with a vet is recommended before starting strenuous or high-impact activities that might cause stress to the dog's bones and joints. Many Goldens happily get their exercise on hunting trips or at field trials, as well as by participating in canine sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking.Stay Up-To-Date About Dog Exercise and ActivitiesGet dog health information conveniently delivered to your inbox each weekEMAIL ADDRESSSIGN UPVIEW ALL THE CHOICES FOR AKC NEWSLETTERS TO RECEIVE THE CONTENT YOU WANT >AKC Privacy PolicyTrainingAs with all breeds, early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended. Gently exposing the puppy to a wide variety of people, places, and situations between the ages of seven weeks and four months will help the Golden develop into a well-adjusted, well-mannered adult. Puppy training classes serve as part of the socialization process and help the owner learn to recognize and correct any bad habits that may be developing. Obedience training strengthens the bond between dog and owner'a Golden wants nothing more than to please his human. Golden Retrievers are outgoing, loyal, and eager to do your bidding, which makes them very easy to train.Stay Up-To-Date About Dog TrainingGet dog health information conveniently delivered to your inbox each weekEMAIL ADDRESSSIGN UPVIEW ALL THE CHOICES FOR AKC NEWSLETTERS TO RECEIVE THE CONTENT YOU WANT >AKC Privacy PolicyNutritionA high-quality dog food appropriate for the dog's age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the breed needs. Some Goldens can become overweight, so watch your dog's calorie consumption and weight level. If you choose to give your dog treats, do so in moderation. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly, if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for dogs, and which are not.
