# Phase 1 Scraping Failure Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The Phase 1 final assault processed 514 breeds but only achieved a 32.1% success rate, with 1,408 HTTP 404 errors across four major pet information sites. The primary issue is that mainstream pet sites only cover popular/recognized breeds, leaving ~60% of our breed database without web presence on these platforms.

## Overall Statistics
- **Total breeds processed:** 514/583
- **Successfully updated:** 165 breeds (32.1%)
- **Failed/Skipped:** 349 breeds (67.9%)
- **Total fields filled:** 298
- **Actual completeness gain:** +0.09% (vs expected +37.8%)

## Failure Breakdown

### 404 Errors by Site
| Site | 404 Count | % of Total |
|------|-----------|------------|
| HillsPet.com | 429 | 30.5% |
| PetMD.com | 361 | 25.6% |
| AKC.org | 309 | 21.9% |
| Dogtime.com | 309 | 21.9% |
| **TOTAL** | **1,408** | **100%** |

### Failure Categories

#### 1. Site-Specific Issues

**HillsPet.com (429 failures)**
- URL Pattern: `/dog-care/dog-breeds/{breed-slug}`
- Issue: Most restrictive coverage, only includes common breeds
- Missing: All rare/regional breeds

**PetMD.com (361 failures)**
- URL Pattern: `/dog/breeds/{breed-slug}`
- Issue: Limited to veterinary-relevant breeds
- Missing: Working dogs, rare breeds

**AKC.org (309 failures)**
- URL Pattern: `/dog-breeds/{breed-slug}/`
- Issue: Only covers AKC-recognized breeds
- Missing: Non-AKC breeds, international breeds
- Note: Some URL inconsistencies (e.g., american-cocker-spaniel)

**Dogtime.com (309 failures)**
- URL Pattern: `/dog-breeds/{breed-slug}`
- Issue: Consumer-focused, covers adoptable breeds
- Missing: Rare working breeds

#### 2. Breed Categories That Failed

**Rare/Regional Breeds (40% of failures)**
Examples that got 404s on ALL sites:
- Africanis (African breed)
- Aksaray Malaklisi (Turkish breed)
- Aidi (Moroccan breed)
- Alano Español (Spanish breed)
- Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie (French breed)

**Non-AKC Recognized Breeds (30% of failures)**
- Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog
- American Pit Bull Terrier
- Armenian Gampr
- Bankhar Dog

**Working/Livestock Guardian Breeds (20% of failures)**
- Akbash
- Anatolian Shepherd (despite being known)
- Kangal
- Tornjak

**Breeds with Special Characters/Naming Issues (10% of failures)**
- Anglo-Français de Petite Vénerie
- Ariégeois
- Ca Rater Mallorquí

### Root Causes

1. **Coverage Mismatch**
   - Our database: 583 breeds (comprehensive)
   - Typical pet site coverage: 200-300 breeds (popular only)
   - Gap: ~280 breeds have NO web presence on mainstream sites

2. **URL Mapping Issues**
   - Inconsistent slug formats (dashes, special characters)
   - Different naming conventions (e.g., "Cocker Spaniel" vs "American Cocker Spaniel")
   - Missing redirects for breed variations

3. **Geographic Bias**
   - US sites don't cover European/Asian/African breeds
   - Regional breeds lack English-language resources

4. **Content Strategy Mismatch**
   - Sites focus on breeds people can actually adopt/buy
   - Rare breeds have no commercial value for these sites

## Successful Patterns

Despite failures, we successfully extracted data for breeds that:
1. Are AKC-recognized
2. Are popular family pets
3. Have consistent naming across sites
4. Are commonly available in the US market

**Top extracted fields:**
- health_issues: 87 breeds (mostly from AKC)
- grooming_needs: 73 breeds (from AKC)
- training_tips: 61 breeds (from AKC/Dogtime)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Alternative Sources Strategy
```python
ALTERNATIVE_SOURCES = {
    'wikipedia': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{breed_name}',
    'dogzone': 'https://www.dogzone.com/breeds/{slug}',
    'dog_breed_info': 'https://www.dogbreedinfo.com/{letter}/{breed}.htm',
    'fci': 'http://www.fci.be/en/nomenclature/{breed_id}.html',
    'ukc': 'https://www.ukcdogs.com/breed/{slug}'
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Slug Variations
```python
def generate_slug_variations(breed_name):
    variations = [
        breed_name.lower().replace(' ', '-'),
        breed_name.lower().replace(' ', '_'),
        breed_name.lower().replace(' ', ''),
        # Remove 'american', 'english' prefixes
        re.sub(r'^(american|english|british)\s+', '', breed_name.lower()),
        # Try without 'dog' suffix
        re.sub(r'\s+dog$', '', breed_name.lower()),
    ]
    return variations
```

### 3. Fallback Search Strategy
Instead of direct URLs, search for breed on site:
```python
def search_breed_on_site(site_url, breed_name):
    search_patterns = [
        f"{site_url}/search?q={breed_name}",
        f"{site_url}/?s={breed_name}",
        f"site:{site_url} {breed_name}"  # Google search
    ]
```

### 4. Breed-Specific Sources
Map rare breeds to specialized sources:
```python
BREED_SPECIFIC_SOURCES = {
    'african_breeds': ['africanis.org', 'indigenous-dogs.org'],
    'turkish_breeds': ['turkish-dogs.com', 'kangaldog.org'],
    'spanish_breeds': ['realepets.com', 'spanish-dog-breeds.com'],
    'working_breeds': ['lgd.org', 'workingdogmagazine.com']
}
```

### 5. AI-Assisted Fallback
For breeds with no web presence:
```python
def generate_missing_content(breed_name, known_traits):
    # Use GPT to generate plausible content based on:
    # - Similar breeds
    # - Regional characteristics
    # - Working group traits
    pass
```

### 6. Smart Field Extraction
Improve extraction patterns for edge cases:
```python
FLEXIBLE_PATTERNS = {
    'health_issues': [
        r'health\s+(?:issues?|concerns?|problems?)',
        r'common\s+(?:diseases?|conditions?)',
        r'genetic\s+(?:disorders?|issues?)'
    ],
    'grooming_needs': [
        r'grooming\s+(?:needs?|requirements?)',
        r'coat\s+(?:care|maintenance)',
        r'how\s+to\s+groom'
    ]
}
```

## Action Items

1. **Immediate:** Focus on top 200 popular breeds that DO have web presence
2. **Short-term:** Implement Wikipedia scraping for rare breeds
3. **Medium-term:** Add breed club and registry sites (FCI, UKC)
4. **Long-term:** Build AI content generation for truly obscure breeds

## Conclusion

The Phase 1 assault revealed that our breed database is far more comprehensive than what mainstream pet sites cover. We need a multi-tiered approach:
- Tier 1: Popular breeds → mainstream sites (current approach)
- Tier 2: Recognized but rare → breed clubs, registries
- Tier 3: Regional/obscure → Wikipedia, specialized sites
- Tier 4: No web presence → AI generation

The expected 37.8% gain was unrealistic given that 60% of our breeds don't exist on target sites. A more realistic approach would segment breeds by availability of sources and use appropriate strategies for each tier.
