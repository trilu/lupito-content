## Technical Implementation

### What Worked
1. **Fixed ScrapingBee configuration:**
   ```python
   params = {
       'api_key': api_key,
       'url': url,
       'render_js': 'true',
       'premium_proxy': 'true',
       'country_code': country_code,
       'wait': '2000',
       'block_ads': 'true'
   }
   ```

2. **Removed problematic parameters:**
   - `custom_google` (only for Google searches)
   - `forward_headers` (caused conflicts)

3. **Implemented English path discovery rule:**
   - Always try English paths for international sites
   - Test multiple common patterns (/collections/, /products/, /shop/)

### What Failed
1. **Bozita:** Page loads but product extraction fails
2. **Cotswold:** Complete blocking at CloudFlare level
3. **Generic paths:** /produkte/ doesn't work on English sites

## API Usage Summary

**Total API credits consumed:** 88
- Belcando: 32 (successful)
- Bozita: 21 (failed)
- Cotswold: 20 (failed)
- Briantos: 15 (partial)

## Definition of Done Assessment

**Required:** At least 2 brands with ≥20 products
**Achieved:** 1 brand with 17 products

### Score: 45/100
- Belcando: 17 products ✓ (85% of target)
- Bozita: 0 products ✗
- Cotswold: 0 products ✗
- Briantos: 2 products (partial)

## Lessons Learned

1. **ScrapingBee limitations:**
   - Works well for sites with moderate protection (Belcando)
   - Fails against CloudFlare and advanced bot detection
   - Monthly API limits can interrupt harvesting

2. **Path discovery importance:**
   - Must check both language variants
   - English paths often exist even on local domains
   - Generic patterns don't always work

3. **Alternative approaches needed:**
   - Browser automation for heavily protected sites
   - API discovery through mobile apps
   - Partnership/licensing for premium brands

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate actions:**
   - Parse the 17 Belcando products captured
   - Try Bozita's Swedish site (bozita.se)
   - Check for Cotswold's wholesale/B2B portal

2. **Future improvements:**
   - Implement Playwright for JavaScript-heavy sites
   - Add automatic language detection for paths
   - Create brand-specific scraping strategies

3. **Business alternatives:**
   - Contact brands directly for data partnership
   - Use product aggregator APIs
   - Focus on brands with less protection

## Conclusion

While the P6 objective was not fully met, we successfully:
1. Fixed ScrapingBee configuration issues
2. Harvested 17 products from Belcando
3. Established that Bozita and Cotswold require more advanced techniques
4. Learned valuable lessons about international site scraping

The partial success with Belcando proves ScrapingBee can work, but more sophisticated approaches are needed for heavily protected sites like Bozita and Cotswold.
