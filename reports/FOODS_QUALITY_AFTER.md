## NEXT STEPS

1. ❌ **Further Enrichment Required** - Quality gates not met
2. Focus on failed gates:
   - Form Coverage ≥ 95%: 53.6% (need 95%)
   - Life Stage Coverage ≥ 95%: 57.3% (need 95%)
   - Price Bucket Coverage ≥ 70%: 27.1% (need 70%)
   - Price per kg Coverage ≥ 50%: 0.0% (need 50%)
   - Zero Critical Outliers: 157% (need 0%)
3. Run targeted enrichment for gaps
4. Re-run quality validation
5. Proceed with swap only after gates pass
