## ðŸ”„ DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

- Allowlist: `['briantos', 'bozita']`
- Read-additive approach preserving existing data

### Step 2: Verification
```sql
-- Check enrichment status
SELECT brand_slug, COUNT(*) as products, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN enrichment_status = 'production' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as enriched
FROM foods_published_prod
WHERE brand_slug IN ('briantos', 'bozita')
GROUP BY brand_slug;
```

### Step 3: Toggle Between Views
```python
# AI/Admin can switch between:
PRODUCTION_VIEW = "foods_published_prod"    # Only allowlisted brands
PREVIEW_VIEW = "foods_published_preview"    # All brands (testing)
```

## ðŸ”™ ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Remove brands from allowlist

cp reports/MANUF/PRODUCTION/foods_published_prod.csv /production/
