Their long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming.The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat.

Bitches are more prone to seasonal flankalopecia, which seems to affect them during the winter.\n\n**Feeding:** Small breed dogs typically need 1/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food daily, divided into two meals. Monitor food intake carefully as lower energy dogs are prone to weight gain.",
            "**Exercise:** Requires substantial daily exercise including vigorous activities, long walks, or active play sessions.\n\n**Training:** Generally trainable with consistent, patient training approaches.\n\n**Health:** Health considerations: Major health issues areallergies,cancer, andhip dysplasia. Like other sighthounds, the Afghan Hound is sensitive toanesthesia, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan Hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to developchylothorax, a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities ofchyle fluidto enter the dog's chest cavity.This condition commonly results in a lung-lobe torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, \"barrel\"-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is often fatal. Among other health problems arelaryngeal paralysis,dilated cardiomyopathy(twice as common in males as females), and dermatological issues such as testosterone-responsivedermatosisof male dogs (often seen in castrated males), nasal depigmentation (also known asDudley nose), andskin tumours. Afghans are also prone toCentral diabetes insipidus(CDI),hypothyroidismandtricholemmoma, a rare condition which mainly affects older dogs in the Middle Ages.Ocular conditions that can occur include medial canthal pocket syndrome (breed predisposition due to shape of head),corneal dystrophy,cataractand generalized progressive retinal atrophy (GPRA). Afghanmyelopathy(causing pelvic limb ataxia) is sometimes reported.\n\n**Feeding:** Medium-sized dogs usually require 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food daily, divided into two meals. High-energy dogs may need additional calories to fuel their active lifestyle.",
            "**Grooming:** Weekly brushing is usually sufficient for coat maintenance.\n\n**Exercise:** Requires substantial daily exercise including vigorous activities, long walks, or active play sessions."
