"" Made with delicious, UK sourced fresh beef

Poppy\'s Picnic POWER BALLS Beef - made with grass fed beef... and no bone!

Simply scrumptious and conveniently portioned for quick, easy, waste-free feeding. Feed as an all-raw diet or add to dry or wet food for a healthy boost of nutrients

Complete and naturally balanced. Fine-tuned by our vet to meet with the highest FEDIAF nutritional guidelines.

No weird ingredients you don’t recognise, no chemicals, flavourings, fillers or artificial additives - just raw dog food, freshly prepared and frozen for your convenience. """,""

"" A single-protein, omega-rich recipe packed with benefits for heart, joint and skin health.

This is a species-appropriate, high meat content dog food made with sustainably sourced herring, gently dehydrated and cold-pressed to retain nutrients and delicate omega oils.

Grain Free. Naturally nourishing. Perfect for dogs who need a little extra support from the inside out.

No fillers, no preservatives, no added vitamins or minerals, no artificial colours or flavours - and absolutely nothing you can’t pronounce. That’s our promise.

Cold-pressed at just 45°C to lock in nutrients that are often destroyed in traditional baked kibble.

Proudly made in the UK, using responsibly sourced ingredients and a single, novel protein source. """,""

"" Made with delicious, UK sourced fresh beef

Poppy’s Picnic MIGHTY MINCE BEEF - made with grass fed beef... and no bone!

By replacing the bone with powdered eggshell, a natural source of calcium, we created the first COOKABLE raw meals. These no-bone recipes are ideal for switching fussy dogs to raw, or for poorly dogs who temporarily need a cooked diet.

Complete and naturally balanced. All MIGHY MINCE recipes are enhanced with botanicals and fine-tuned by our vet to meet with the highest FEDIAF nutritional guidelines.

Our great new pulp trays have a bio-laminate liner and are fully compostable or can be recycled with paper, reducing plastic use by over 90%

No weird ingredients you don’t recognise, no chemicals, flavourings, fillers or artificial additives – just raw dog food, freshly prepared and frozen for your convenience. """,""

"" A lean, single-protein recipe that’s easy on digestion - and big on flavour.

This is a species-appropriate, high meat content dog food made with low-fat, low-purine rabbit, gently dehydrated and cold-pressed (in the UK) for convenience.

Grain Free. Naturally gentle. Perfect for dogs needing a lighter touch.

No fillers, no preservatives, no added vitamins or minerals, no artificial colours or flavours - and absolutely nothing you can’t pronounce. That’s our promise.

Cold-pressed at just 45°C to lock in nutrients that are often destroyed in traditional baked kibble.

Proudly made in the UK, using a single, novel protein source.

Ideal for dogs who thrive on a lighter, cleaner diet - whether they’re managing sensitivities, weight, or just living life a little leaner. """,""
