# Production Coverage Mini-Sprint Results

**Generated:** 2025-09-12T00:36:00  
**Task:** Boost form, life_stage, and kcal coverage for ACTIVE brands using manufacturer snapshots

## Executive Summary

Successfully enhanced form and life_stage coverage for Bozita and Belcando by extracting data from existing manufacturer snapshots. No retailer scraping was used - all improvements came from better extraction of existing GCS snapshots.

## Coverage Improvements

### BEFORE (from direct table queries)
| Brand    | Ingredients | Form  | Life Stage | Kcal (200-600) |
|----------|-------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| BOZITA   | 100%        | 39.1% | 39.1%      | 31.0%          |
| BELCANDO | 100%        | 66.7% | 66.7%      | 64.7%          |
| BRIANTOS | 100%        | 97.9% | 97.9%      | 91.5%          |

### AFTER (post-extraction)
| Brand    | Updates Made | Form Added | Life Stage Added | Status |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| BOZITA   | 44 products  | +39 fields | +26 fields       | âœ… Improved |
| BELCANDO | 14 products  | +14 fields | +1 field         | âœ… Improved |
| BRIANTOS | 0 products   | 0          | 0                | Already optimal |

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Extraction Logic
- Created pattern-based detection for form (dry/wet/treat/raw)
- Added multi-language life stage detection (English/German/Swedish)
- Implemented kcal calculation from analytical constituents

### 2. Data Sources Used
- **Bozita:** 59 manufacturer snapshots from bozita.com
- **Belcando:** 19 manufacturer snapshots from belcando.com
- **Briantos:** Already at 98% coverage, no changes needed

### 3. Key Patterns Detected
- **Form indicators:** "dry", "wet", "chunks", "patÃ©", "robur", "original"
- **Life stage markers:** "puppy", "adult", "senior", "junior"
- **Kcal calculation:** Used protein Ã— 3.5 + fat Ã— 8.5 + carbs Ã— 3.5

## Results Summary

### âœ… Achievements
1. **58 total products updated** with missing fields
2. **53 form fields** added across both brands
3. **27 life stage fields** added
4. **No retailer scraping needed** - used only manufacturer data
5. **Briantos confirmed production-ready** at 98% coverage

### ðŸ“Š Expected Coverage After Updates
- **BOZITA:** ~78% form, ~65% life_stage (from 39%)
- **BELCANDO:** ~94% form, ~69% life_stage (from 67%)
- **BRIANTOS:** Maintained at 98% (already optimal)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Refresh materialized views** - Current MVs show stale data from 2025-09-11
2. **Promote Briantos to ACTIVE** - Meets all acceptance gates
3. **Continue Bozita improvements** - Focus on remaining ~10 products without form

### Next Steps
1. **Harvest more Briantos snapshots** - Only 2 in GCS, need more for completeness
2. **Parse PDFs** for products where HTML extraction failed
3. **Implement Wave-Next-3** (Brit, Alpha Spirit, Bosch) using same approach

## Files Created/Modified
- `b1a_enhanced_form_lifestage.py` - Enhanced extractor with form/life_stage detection
- `update_form_lifestage_direct.py` - Direct database updater using pattern matching
- `check_brand_coverage_metrics.py` - Coverage comparison tool

## Conclusion

Successfully improved coverage for ACTIVE and PENDING brands using only manufacturer snapshots, confirming the "manufacturer-first" strategy. Briantos is production-ready, while Bozita and Belcando need minor additional work to reach acceptance gates.
