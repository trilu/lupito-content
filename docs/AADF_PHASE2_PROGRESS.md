## Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Fuzzy Matching âœ…
- **Script**: `scripts/match_aadf_fuzzy.py`
- **Results**: Found 40 high-confidence matches
- **Coverage improvement**: 71.8% â†’ 74.2%

### Phase 2: Review Page Scraping ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- **Script**: `scripts/scrape_aadf_review_images.py`
- **Status**: Actively running
- **Progress**: 96 images scraped so far (as of 5:52 PM)
- **Coverage improvement**: 74.2% â†’ 80.0% (and climbing)
- **Expected completion**: ~30-40 minutes
- **Target**: Processing 344 products with review URLs

## Key Features of Review Scraper

### Image Detection Strategy
1. Multiple CSS selectors for finding product images
2. Filters out placeholder/icon images
3. Falls back to Open Graph images if needed
4. Validates image URLs before downloading

### Rate Limiting
- Adaptive delays: 2-3s (night), 4-6s (day)
- Respects robots.txt
- No issues encountered so far

### Error Handling
- Logs successful downloads to `/tmp/aadf_review_success_*.json`
- Logs failures to `/tmp/aadf_review_failed_*.json`
- Continues processing even if individual products fail

## Current Status
- **Total AADF products**: 1,648
- **With images**: 1,319 (80.0%)
- **Without images**: 329
- **Scraper processing**: 344 products
- **Success rate so far**: 100% (96/96)

## Monitoring
- Created `scripts/monitor_aadf_scraping.py` for real-time progress tracking
- Updates every 30 seconds
- Will automatically detect completion at >95% coverage

## Next Steps
1. Wait for scraper completion (~20-30 more minutes)
2. Review final coverage metrics
3. If needed, proceed to Phase 3 (manual resolution) for any remaining products

## Expected Final Results
- **Target coverage**: 97-99% (1,600+ products with images)
- **Remaining products**: ~20-50 (likely discontinued or special cases)
