I need to start a targeted orchestrator to scrape the 227 missing products from zooplus that don‚Äôt have ingredients or nutrition data.

  üìÅ Location: /Users/sergiubiris/Desktop/lupito-content/data/

  1. zooplus_missing_ingredients_20250913.txt (53KB)
    - Human-readable format with numbered list
    - Shows brand, product name, product key, and full URL
    - Easy to browse and review
  2. zooplus_missing_ingredients_20250913.csv (47KB)
    - CSV format for spreadsheet applications
    - Columns: product_key, product_name, brand, product_url
    - Perfect for data analysis
  3. zooplus_missing_ingredients_20250913.json (71KB)
    - JSON format for programmatic use
    - Includes metadata (export date, description)
    - Structured data for scrapers

  üìä SUMMARY

  - Total products: 227 (exactly what we need for 95% coverage)
  - All are Zooplus products currently missing ingredients
  - Each has complete data: product_key, name, brand, and URL
  - URLs are clean and ready for scraping

  üéØ NEXT STEPS

Create a targeted scraper that:
  1. Reads from one of these files (JSON recommended for scrapers)
  2. Works through the specific 227 products only
  3. Avoids the inefficiency of offset-based targeting
  4. Focuses 100% effort on achieving 95% coverage

  The files are ready to use for efficient, targeted scraping that will maximize our ingredient coverage
  without wasted effort!

We have robust scraping infra in place via ScrapingBee.
