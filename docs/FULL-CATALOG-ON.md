## Row Cap Removal

The 1000-row limitation was found in:
- pilot_enrichment_preview.py (line 43): `.limit(1000)` when fetching from foods_canonical
- This was likely used for testing/development

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Identified all source tables with full data
2. ✅ Verified foods_canonical can access full catalog
3. ✅ Checked array field types are JSONB
4. ✅ Removed any LIMIT clauses in production code

## Verification

Full catalog is now accessible with:
- No LIMIT clauses in canonical queries
- Array fields properly typed as JSONB
- All source data available for processing

## Next Steps

- Run Prompt B: Re-apply brand canonicalization on full data
- Run Prompt C: Re-run enrichment pipeline
- Run Prompt D: Recompute brand quality metrics
