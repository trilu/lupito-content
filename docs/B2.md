PDF nutrition/ingredients extractor (when HTML missing)

Goal: Fill ingredients when sites use PDF spec sheets.
Scope: Pages flagged by B1 as PDF-only. Use GCS PDFs first; if missing, fetch via respectful client with low rate limits.
Tasks:
	1.	Detect nutrition/ingredients tables in PDFs (multi-language headers above).
	2.	Extract ingredients_raw; canonicalize → ingredients_tokens; set ingredients_source='label_pdf'.
	3.	If macros/kJ present, normalize: convert kJ → kcal (÷ 4.184), store kcal_source='converted_kj'; only compute derived kcal if macros present and kcal missing.
	4.	Log parse confidence; skip low-confidence pages rather than writing junk.
Deliverables:

	•	NUTRITION_PASS2_REPORT.md with added coverage, list of PDFs parsed, and 5 “before/after” product rows (ids masked).
Acceptance gate: push each affected brand to ≥ 80% ingredients coverage (or show the small remainder that’s genuinely unavailable).
