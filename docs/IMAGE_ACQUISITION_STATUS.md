3. **Total**: 3,851 new images in GCS

### Database Updates
- Fixed key format mismatch for AADF products
- Updated 3,758 products with GCS URLs
- Improved overall coverage from ~40% to ~70%

### Scripts Created/Modified
1. `scripts/download_aadf_images.py` - AADF image downloader
2. `scripts/download_zooplus_images.py` - Zooplus image downloader
3. `scripts/update_database_gcs_urls_fixed.py` - Fixed update script with key transformation
4. `scripts/monitor_downloads.py` - Real-time download monitoring

## Failed Downloads Log
- AADF: 6 failed downloads logged in `data/aadf_failed_downloads_*.json`
- Zooplus: 1 failed download logged in `data/zooplus_failed_downloads_*.json`

## Next Steps Priority

### High Priority
1. **Implement AADF remaining images plan** (465 products)
   - See: `docs/AADF_REMAINING_IMAGES_PLAN.md`
   - Expected to reach 97-99% coverage

2. **Investigate Zooplus CSV imports** (840 products)
   - Understand why these don't match
   - May need different scraping approach

### Medium Priority
3. **Migrate Supabase storage to GCS** (3,767 products)
   - Consolidate all images in one location
   - Simplify maintenance

4. **Handle products with no URLs** (414 products)
   - Manual investigation needed
   - May be test data or incomplete imports

### Low Priority
5. **Verify and re-download failed images**
   - Only 7 total failures
   - Can be handled manually

## Technical Notes

### Key Format Issues
- **Database format**: `brand|product_name|type`
- **GCS format**: `brand_product_name_type`
- Solution: Transform keys during matching

### Rate Limiting Used
- **AADF**: 2-3s (night), 4-6s (day)
- **Zooplus**: 3-4s (night), 6-8s (day)
- No robots.txt violations detected
