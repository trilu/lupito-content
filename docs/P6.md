Unblock the blocked (ScrapingBee pass)

Goal: Re-capture and parse brands blocked by site protections.

Do:
	•	Brands: briantos, belcando, bozita, cotswold.
	•	Use ScrapingBee with EU locale headers and JS rendering where needed:
	•	Accept-Language: de-DE,de;q=0.9,en;q=0.8
	•	User-Agent: modern desktop
	•	Country/geo params if available
	•	Snapshot product pages (≥20 per brand if possible), then parse as in Prompt 4.
	•	Record source as ingredients_source=manufacturer_site (or pdf), and use macros_source/kcal_source appropriately.
	•	Output BLOCKED_SITES_REPORT.md with success rate, remaining blocks, and proposed next steps.

Definition of done:
	•	At least two of the four brands produce ≥20 parsed products with either valid macros or ingredient tokens.
