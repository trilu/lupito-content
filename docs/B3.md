JS-rendered sections (last mile)

Goal: Capture pages where ingredients render only after JS (tabs/accordions).
Scope: The residual URLs from B1/B2 that still lack ingredients.
Tasks:
	1.	Use ScrapingBee with JS rendering (headless) to fetch those URLs; keep 3–5s delay and jitter.
	2.	Reuse the B1 selector map on the rendered HTML; upsert ingredients_raw/tokens with ingredients_source='site_text_js'.
	3.	Store the rendered snapshots back to GCS under /manufacturers/{brand}/rendered/{date}/.
Deliverables:

	•	NUTRITION_PASS3_REPORT.md showing incremental lift and a tiny “still missing” list with reasons.
Acceptance gate: each brand reaches ≥ 85% ingredients coverage.
