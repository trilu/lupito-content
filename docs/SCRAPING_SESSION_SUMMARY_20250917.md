# Dog Food Content Scraping Session Summary
*Date: September 17, 2025*

## Overview
This session focused on completing scraping tasks for pending dog food products from two major sources: Zooplus and AllAboutDogFood (AADF). The primary goal was to extract ingredients, nutrition data, and images to improve database coverage for the content publication pipeline.

## Session Achievements

### 1. Zooplus Scraping - 100% Success Rate

#### Initial Status
- 208 products marked as PENDING in database
- Previously failed scraping attempts
- Missing ingredients, nutrition, and image data

#### Work Completed
- **All 208 products successfully scraped** using Pattern 8 extraction
- **Retried 19 initially failed products** - all successful on retry
- **Processed to database:**
  - Images: 207/208 products (99.5%)
  - Nutrition data: 207/208 products (99.5%)
  - Ingredients: 206/208 products (99.0%)

#### Technical Challenges Resolved
1. **Database Constraint Issues:**
   - Error: `ingredients_tokens` field required JSON array format
   - Solution: Created parser to convert comma-separated strings to proper JSON arrays
   - Error: `ingredients_source` must be 'site' per database constraint
   - Solution: Changed from 'zooplus_pattern_8' to 'site'

2. **Extraction Pattern:**
   - Used Pattern 8: Most reliable Zooplus extraction pattern
   - Successfully handled German language content
   - Proper parsing of compound ingredients with parentheses

#### Data Storage
- **GCS Location:** `gs://lupito-content-raw-eu/scraped/zooplus_retry/`
- **Sessions:**
  - `20250916_222711_full_208/` - Main batch
  - `20250916_224539_retry_19/` - Retry batch

### 2. AADF Scraping - Partial Success

#### Initial Status
- 413 products from AllAboutDogFood
- Images: 99.8% complete (from previous scraping)
- Ingredients: 0% complete
- Nutrition: 0% complete

#### Work Completed
- **Created new scraper** with ScrapingBee API for anti-bot protection
- **Successfully scraped 409/413 pages** (99% success rate)
- **Bypassed Cloudflare protection** using premium proxies
- **Duration:** 58 minutes with rate limiting (4-6 seconds between requests)

#### Issues Encountered
1. **HTML Structure Complexity:**
   - AADF uses complex table-based layouts
   - Ingredients stored in "Mixing bowl" sections
   - Nutrition data in nested tables
   - Initial parser extracted placeholder text instead of actual data

2. **Data Quality:**
   - All 409 products had placeholder text: "This is the ingredients list as printed on the packaging or manufacturer's website"
   - Nutrition patterns didn't match HTML structure
   - **Decision:** Cleared bad data from database

#### Data Storage
- **GCS Location:** `gs://lupito-content-raw-eu/scraped/aadf_ingredients/aadf_ingredients_20250917_123937/`
- **Status:** Raw HTML saved for potential future reprocessing

## Final Database Coverage

### Zooplus Products (208 total)
| Field | Coverage | Count |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Images | 99.5% | 207/208 |
| Ingredients | 99.0% | 206/208 |
| Nutrition | 99.5% | 207/208 |
| **Overall** | **99.0%** | **206/208** |

### AADF Products (413 total)
| Field | Coverage | Count |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Images | 99.8% | 412/413 |
| Ingredients | 0% | 0/413 |
| Nutrition | 0% | 0/413 |
| **Overall** | **33.3%** | **412/413** (images only) |

## Technical Implementation

### Key Scripts Created/Used

1. **Zooplus Scrapers:**
   - `scripts/scrape_all_208_zooplus.py` - Main batch scraper
   - `scripts/retry_failed_19_zooplus.py` - Retry scraper for failures
   - `scripts/process_zooplus_gcs_to_db.py` - GCS to database processor
   - `scripts/process_zooplus_ingredients_to_array.py` - Ingredients formatter

2. **AADF Scrapers:**
   - `scripts/scrape_aadf_ingredients_nutrition.py` - Main AADF scraper with ScrapingBee
   - `scripts/test_aadf_scraping.py` - HTML structure analyzer

### Database Constraints Discovered

```python
# Required field formats:
ingredients_tokens: JSON array (e.g., ["chicken", "rice", "vegetables"])
ingredients_source: Must be 'site' (enum constraint)
protein_percent: Float (0-100)
fat_percent: Float (0-100)
fiber_percent: Float (0-100)
```

### Scraping Patterns

#### Zooplus Pattern 8
```python
# Most reliable pattern for Zooplus
pattern = r'Zusammensetzung[:\s]*</strong>\s*</p>\s*<p[^>]*>(.*?)</p>'
# Handles German language content
# Extracts from specific HTML structure
```

#### AADF Challenges
- Complex table-based layouts
- JavaScript-rendered content
- Cloudflare protection requiring ScrapingBee API
- Ingredients in "Mixing bowl" sections not standard HTML

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Zooplus:** Data is production-ready with 99% coverage
2. **AADF:** Accept current image-only coverage (99.8%)

### Future Improvements
1. **AADF Reprocessing:**
   - Raw HTML is saved in GCS for future attempts
   - Would require sophisticated table parser
   - Consider manual extraction for high-value products

2. **Database Updates:**
   - Ensure all ingredients use consistent array format
   - Validate nutrition percentages are within 0-100 range

## Session Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Total Duration | ~3 hours |
| Products Processed | 621 (208 Zooplus + 413 AADF) |
| Success Rate (Zooplus) | 100% |
| Success Rate (AADF) | 99% scraping, 0% extraction |
| Database Updates | 206 Zooplus products fully updated |
| GCS Storage Used | ~409 JSON files |

## Conclusion

The session successfully completed all Zooplus scraping with 100% success rate and proper database integration. AADF scraping was technically successful (99% pages scraped) but extraction failed due to complex HTML structure. The pragmatic decision to maintain AADF's excellent image coverage (99.8%) while accepting the lack of ingredients/nutrition data allows the project to move forward with substantial improvements to the Zooplus dataset.
