  - `foods_canonical`: 5,151 rows (deduplicated)
  - `foods_published_preview`: 5,151 rows
  - `foods_published_prod`: 80 rows (limited by quality gates)

**Technical Verification**:
```
✅ Array fields confirmed as JSONB:
- ingredients_tokens: JSONB array
- available_countries: JSONB array
- sources: JSONB array
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Full catalog access confirmed

## 🚨 Critical Issues & Recommendations

### Issue 1: Low Enrichment Coverage
**Problem**: Only 68% of products have complete classification  
**Impact**: Only 1 brand qualifies for production  
**Recommendation**: 
- Implement ML-based classification using product descriptions
- Add manual review queue for ambiguous products
- Consider external data sources for enrichment

### Issue 2: Limited Production Pipeline
**Problem**: Strict quality gates limiting production to 80 SKUs  
**Impact**: Limited product availability for users  
**Recommendation**:
- Consider tiered quality levels (Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- Allow provisional promotion with warnings
- Implement gradual quality improvement post-promotion

### Issue 3: Missing Brand Data
**Problem**: Some brands have 0% form coverage  
**Impact**: Major brands like base Purina lacking critical data  
**Recommendation**:
- Priority enrichment queue for high-value brands
- Brand-specific enrichment rules
- Manual data entry for top 20 brands

---

## 📋 Action Plan

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Manual enrichment** of top 20 brands
2. **Lower gates temporarily** to 70% to allow more promotions
3. **Fix Purina form data** (currently 0%)

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
1. **Implement improved classifier** for form/life_stage
2. **Harvest additional data** for brands with <5 SKUs
3. **Create enrichment dashboard** for monitoring progress

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)
1. **ML model training** for automatic classification
2. **API integration** with brand websites
3. **Crowd-sourcing** for data validation

## ✅ Conclusion

The BRAND-QUAL-LOCK1 initiative has successfully established a comprehensive data quality framework for the Lupito food catalog database. While the infrastructure is now robust and automated, the primary challenge remains data enrichment coverage.

**Key Success**: Framework is production-ready with automated monitoring  
**Key Challenge**: 32% of products need enrichment to meet quality gates  
**Next Priority**: Aggressive enrichment campaign focusing on form and life_stage classification

The system is now positioned for rapid scaling once enrichment coverage improves. The weekly automation ensures ongoing quality monitoring and prevents regression.
