## Next Steps

1. **Continue Monitoring** - Scrapers are running autonomously
2. **Wait for Completion** - Estimated 30-45 minutes
3. **Process GCS Data** - Run processor to update database
4. **Verify Coverage** - Check if we reached 95% goal

## Notes

- All 3 sessions are running concurrently with good success rates
- Pattern 8 (relaxed extraction) is available but hasn't been needed yet
- The extraction rate of 70.6% is good and should help us reach the 95% coverage goal
- No major errors encountered so far
