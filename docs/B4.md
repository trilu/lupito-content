Lock & prove

Goal: Prove we’re production-worthy and lock in improvements.
Tasks:
	1.	Recompute per-brand metrics for bozita, belcando, briantos:
	•	ingredients tokens ≥ 85%, kcal (200–600) ≥ 70%, macros (protein+fat) ≥ 70%.
	2.	Write FOODS_ENRICHMENT_BEFORE_AFTER.md (single table per brand + combined) with PASS/NEAR/TODO badges.
	3.	If PASS, provide the exact SQL to refresh MVs and (optionally) promote brand(s) to ACTIVE in brand_allowlist (don’t execute until I say so).
	4.	Export a 10-row sample CSV (ids masked) showing the newly filled ingredients_raw + ingredients_tokens for manual spot-check.
Acceptance gate: Two brands at ≥85% ingredients coverage with clean provenance and no schema regressions.
