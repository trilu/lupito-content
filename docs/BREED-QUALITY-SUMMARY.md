  What Teams Can Build Next

  With this data foundation, teams can now develop:

  1. Breed Comparison Tools
    - Compare 2-3 breeds side by side
    - Filter by size, energy, trainability
    - Match breeds to lifestyle preferences
  2. Breed Recommendation Engine
    - Quiz-based breed matching
    - Lifestyle compatibility scoring
    - First-time owner recommendations
  3. Educational Content
    - Breed care guides
    - Training tips by breed
    - Health monitoring by breed characteristics
  4. Search & Discovery Features
    - Advanced filtering (size + energy + trainability)
    - Breed alias search (e.g., "Doodle" breeds)
    - Similar breed suggestions
  5. Data Visualizations
    - Size distribution charts
    - Energy vs trainability matrices
    - Breed popularity by characteristics

  Data Access

  - Database: PostgreSQL via Supabase
  - API: REST API with real-time subscriptions
  - Format: JSON responses with nested content
  - Authentication: Supabase Auth ready

  Next Steps for Data Team

  To reach Grade A (90%+):
  - Add weight data for remaining 167 breeds (28.6%)
  - Enhance lifespan data (currently 38.8% coverage)
  - Add height data for remaining breeds (32.8% missing)

  The database is production-ready for frontend development with comprehensive content for most popular breeds and excellent data quality
  for breeds with complete information.
