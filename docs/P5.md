Deep product discovery (Brit, Alpha, Forthglade)

Goal: For brands where we only captured category pages, discover product URLs properly, re-snapshot, then parse.

Do:
	•	Brands: brit, alpha, forthglade.
	•	Implement multi-strategy discovery: follow category pagination, parse product tiles, use JSON-LD Product entries, and capture canonical product URLs.
	•	Snapshot up to 30 product pages per brand (rate-limited).
	•	Then parse the new snapshots for ingredients + macros exactly as in Prompt 4.
	•	Write a DISCOVERY_REPORT.md: pages scanned, product URLs found, snapshot counts, parse coverage deltas.

Definition of done:
	•	Each brand has ≥20 product pages parsed with non-empty ingredients_tokens or at least ≥60% macros coverage.
	•	New coverage metrics appended to the report.
