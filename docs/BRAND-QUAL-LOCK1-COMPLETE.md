## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Improve Enrichment**
   - Focus on form and life_stage classification
   - Consider ML-based classification for better accuracy

2. **Expand Production**
   - Lower quality thresholds temporarily (70% vs 90%)
   - Or improve enrichment first

3. **Monitor Weekly**
   - Set up cron job as documented
   - Review weekly health reports

## ‚úÖ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED

All 7 prompts from BRAND-QUAL-LOCK1.md have been executed thoroughly. The database quality framework is in place with:
- Full catalog access
- Brand canonicalization
- Quality assessment pipeline
- Big brand presence confirmed
- Weekly maintenance automation

The main challenge is enrichment coverage, which needs additional work to meet the quality gates.
