# Wikipedia Scraping Quality Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL ISSUE: The Wikipedia re-scraping campaign FAILED to update the breeds_details table**

The Labrador Retriever is STILL marked as "small" with weight 0.82-1.0 kg, which was the original problem we were trying to fix.

## Key Findings

### 1. Data Not Updated ❌
- **breeds_details table**: Still contains old, incorrect data from September 6th
- **Labrador Retriever**: Still marked as "small" with 0.82-1.0 kg weight
- **Last updated**: 2025-09-06 (NOT updated by our scraping campaign)

### 2. Critical Breeds Missing from Scraping List ❌
The following popular breeds were NOT included in the Wikipedia scraping URLs:
- Labrador Retriever
- German Shepherd
- Golden Retriever
- French Bulldog
- Bulldog
- Poodle
- Beagle
- Rottweiler

These are the most popular dog breeds and they were completely missing from our scraping campaign!

### 3. Quality Metrics (Based on Old Data)

#### Coverage
- Breeds in benchmark: 546
- Breeds in scraped table: 583
- Matched breeds: 493 (90.3% coverage)

#### Size Accuracy: 0% ❌
- Size matches: 0/493 (0.0%)
- ALL breeds have mismatched size categories
- Examples:
  - Golden Retriever: Should be Large, marked as small
  - Labrador Retriever: Should be Large, marked as small
  - Great Dane: Should be Giant, marked as small

#### Weight Accuracy: 28.5% ❌
- Only 97/340 breeds have weights within 20% tolerance
- Major discrepancies:
  - Labrador: Benchmark 30.6kg, Scraped 0.82-1.0kg (29.7kg difference!)
  - Golden Retriever: Benchmark 30kg, Scraped 4.54-5.44kg (25kg difference!)
  - Great Dane: Benchmark 64kg, Scraped 13.61-27.22kg (44kg difference!)

#### Data Completeness: 61.3% ⚠️
- Has weight data: 69.6%
- Has height data: 67.2%
- Has life expectancy: 38.8%
- Has size category: 69.5%

### Overall Quality Score: 1/5 (20%) ❌

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Wrong Breed List
The Wikipedia URLs file (`wikipedia_urls.txt`) does NOT contain the most popular breeds. It appears to be a list of rare/uncommon breeds instead.

### Problem 2: Scraper Not Updating breeds_details
Our Wikipedia scraper was designed to update breeds_details, but:
1. The breeds we scraped were NOT the ones with problems
2. The critical breeds (Labrador, German Shepherd, etc.) were never scraped
3. The breeds_details table still contains corrupted data from September 6th

### Problem 3: Data Corruption in breeds_details
The existing data in breeds_details is severely corrupted:
- Weights are off by orders of magnitude
- Size categories are completely wrong
- The data appears to have parsing errors (possibly unit conversion issues)

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Create Correct Breed List
```python
# Get all breeds from breeds_details that need fixing
SELECT breed_slug, display_name, size, weight_kg_min, weight_kg_max
FROM breeds_details
WHERE breed_slug IN ('labrador-retriever', 'german-shepherd', 'golden-retriever', ...)
```

### 2. Scrape Critical Breeds
Focus on the top 100 most popular breeds first:
- Labrador Retriever
- German Shepherd
- Golden Retriever
- French Bulldog
- Bulldog
- Poodle
- Beagle
- Rottweiler
- Yorkshire Terrier
- Dachshund
... etc

### 3. Verify Data Updates
After scraping, verify that breeds_details is actually updated:
```python
# Check updated_at timestamp
SELECT breed_slug, updated_at, size, weight_kg_min, weight_kg_max
FROM breeds_details
WHERE DATE(updated_at) = CURRENT_DATE
```

## Conclusion

The Wikipedia scraping campaign was executed on the wrong set of breeds. The critical breeds with data quality issues (especially Labrador Retriever) were never scraped because they weren't in the URL list. The breeds_details table still contains the corrupted data from September 6th.

**The original problem of Labrador Retriever being marked as "small" with 0.82-1.0 kg weight remains UNFIXED.**

## Next Steps

1. **URGENT**: Create a new breed list containing the actual breeds in breeds_details
2. **URGENT**: Scrape Wikipedia pages for critical breeds (Labrador, German Shepherd, etc.)
3. **VERIFY**: Ensure breeds_details table is actually updated after scraping
4. **TEST**: Re-run quality analysis to confirm fixes

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours to properly fix all critical breeds
