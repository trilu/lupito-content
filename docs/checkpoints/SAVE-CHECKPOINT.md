# Checkpoint: Final Zooplus 227 Products Scraping & 95% Coverage Achievement
**Date:** September 14, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Scraping final 227 Zooplus products to reach 95% coverage goal

## üéâ Major Achievement: 95.4% Zooplus Coverage Reached!

### Final Coverage Statistics
- **Zooplus Products:** 3,510 total
- **With Ingredients:** 3,350 products (95.4% coverage) ‚úÖ
- **Overall Database:** 5,136 of 8,926 products have ingredients (57.5%)

## Session Summary

### Initial Goal
- Scrape 227 specific Zooplus products that were missing ingredients
- Target: Achieve 95% coverage for Zooplus products
- Files: `data/zooplus_missing_ingredients_20250913.json`

### What We Built

#### 1. Targeted Scraper System
**File:** `scripts/scrape_zooplus_final_227.py`
- Reads from specific JSON list of 227 products
- Supports multi-session concurrent scraping
- Uses 8 extraction patterns including Pattern 8 (relaxed extraction)
- Saves to GCS with session-based folders

#### 2. Monitoring Dashboard
**File:** `scripts/monitor_final_227.py`
- Real-time progress tracking
- Multi-session statistics
- Pattern usage analysis
- ETA calculations

#### 3. GCS Processing Pipeline
**File:** `scripts/process_final_227_gcs.py`
- Processes scraped data from GCS
- Updates database with ingredients and nutrition
- Tracks processed folders to avoid duplicates

#### 4. Rescraping System for Remaining Products
**File:** `scripts/rescrape_remaining_160.py`
- Enhanced with 12+ extraction patterns
- Better retry logic and error handling
- URL variant testing capabilities

### Execution Results

#### Phase 1: Initial Scraping
- **Launched:** 3 concurrent sessions (US, GB, DE)
- **Completed:** 108 of 227 products (47.6%)
- **Issue:** GCS authentication expired mid-scraping, causing processes to hang

#### Phase 2: Processing
- **Processed:** 108 products from GCS
- **Database Updates:** 101 products updated
- **Ingredients Added:** 67 new products with ingredients
- **Success Rate:** 93.5% for database updates

#### Phase 3: Achievement
- **Goal Reached:** 95.4% coverage achieved with partial scraping
- **Remaining:** 160 products still without ingredients
- **Status:** Goal accomplished despite incomplete scraping

### Technical Issues Encountered

1. **GCS Authentication Problems**
   - Initial: User authentication kept expiring
   - Solution Found: Service account at `secrets/gcp-sa.json`
   - Issue: gsutil CLI requires interactive auth, Python SDK works with service account

2. **Process Hanging**
   - Scrapers got stuck at 100% CPU in infinite loops
   - Root cause: GCS authentication failures during upload

3. **Rescraping Failures**
   - All 160 remaining products failed with "All URL variants failed"
   - Direct ScrapingBee tests work fine
   - Likely bug in error handling logic of rescraper

### Extraction Patterns Used Successfully

```python
# Pattern distribution from 108 scraped products:
Pattern 1: 23 products  # Standard Ingredients/composition
Pattern 3: 20 products  # Ingredients with variant info
Pattern 2: 17 products  # Ingredients with product description
Pattern 10: 3 products  # New pattern for specific formats
Pattern 9: 3 products   # Alternative pattern
Pattern 4: 1 product    # Simple Ingredients: format
```

### GCS Folders Created

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rescrape_160_*/                  (attempted but failed)
```

### Remaining 160 Products Analysis

**Top Missing Brands:**
- IAMS, Advance, Alpha Spirit, Arquivet
- Belcando, Bosch, Bozita, Brit (multiple products)
- Burns, Calibra, Carnilove
- 140+ more products

**Likely Reasons for Failure:**
- Unusual page structures requiring manual intervention
- Products without ingredients listed on site
- Discontinued or special variant products
- Potential bugs in scraper error handling

## Key Learnings

1. **GCS Authentication:**
   - Service account (`secrets/gcp-sa.json`) more reliable than user auth
   - Must use absolute path for GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
   - Python SDK works better than gsutil CLI for automation

2. **Scraping Strategy:**
   - Pattern 8 (relaxed extraction) helpful for difficult products
   - Multi-session concurrency speeds up processing
   - Need better error handling to prevent infinite loops

3. **Coverage Goals:**
   - 95% is achievable but last 5% contains difficult edge cases
   - Partial completion (108/227) was enough to reach goal
   - Diminishing returns on effort for final percentages

## Current System State

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- GCS service account authentication
- Database update pipeline
- Monitoring systems
- ScrapingBee API connection

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Address
- Rescraper script has bug in error handling
- gsutil CLI requires manual authentication
- Some Zooplus products have incompatible page structures

### üìä Database State
- **Total Products:** 8,926
- **With Ingredients:** 5,136 (57.5%)
- **Zooplus Coverage:** 3,350/3,510 (95.4%) ‚úÖ
- **Goal Achieved:** Yes

## Next Steps (Optional)

Since the 95% coverage goal has been achieved, further work is optional:

1. **Debug rescraper** for remaining 160 products (4.6% of Zooplus)
2. **Manual review** of failed products to understand page structure issues
3. **Focus on other sources** to improve overall 57.5% database coverage
4. **Document patterns** that worked for future scraping efforts

## Commands for Reference

```bash
# Monitor scraping progress
source venv/bin/activate
python scripts/monitor_final_227.py --once

# Process GCS data to database
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/Users/sergiubiris/Desktop/lupito-content/secrets/gcp-sa.json
python scripts/process_final_227_gcs.py

# Check coverage statistics
python -c "
from supabase import create_client
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
# ... (statistics query code)
"
```

## Conclusion

**Mission Accomplished!** We successfully achieved 95.4% Zooplus coverage, exceeding the 95% target. While technical challenges prevented complete scraping of all 227 targeted products, the partial completion (108 products with 67 new ingredients) was sufficient to reach the goal. The remaining 160 products represent edge cases that would require disproportionate effort for minimal coverage improvement.

### Rescraping Attempt #2: Using Robust Infrastructure
After the initial rescraper failed, switched to using the proven orchestrator infrastructure:

1. **Created New Scraper**: `scripts/scrape_final_160_orchestrated.py`
   - Based on successful `orchestrated_scraper.py` patterns
   - Uses correct ScrapingBee parameters (no javascript_snippet, no block_resources)
   - Implements all 10 extraction patterns including Pattern 8
   - Service account authentication configured

2. **Launched Two Sessions**:
   - US1 session: Products 0-80 (PID 88586)
   - GB1 session: Products 80-160 (PID 88637)
   - Both running successfully with 15-35 second delays

3. **Current Progress**: 
   - 20 files scraped to GCS (12.5% complete)
   - Rate: ~1 product/minute across both sessions
   - ETA: ~2.5 hours for completion
   - GCS folders: `final_160_20250914_153532_us1` and `final_160_20250914_153538_gb1`

4. **Monitoring**: Created `scripts/monitor_final_160.py` for real-time progress tracking

The robust infrastructure approach is working where the custom rescraper failed. The key was using the exact proven ScrapingBee parameters without any experimental additions.
