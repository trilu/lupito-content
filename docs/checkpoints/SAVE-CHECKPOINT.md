**Saved:** 2025-09-12T13:48:00  
**Branch:** main  
**Status:** Complete ‚úÖ  
**Previous:** 2025-09-12T13:30:00

## üéØ Session Achievements (Continuation from 13:30)

### 1. COMPLETE Brand Normalization Applied ‚úÖ
Successfully applied full brand normalization to entire foods_canonical database:

**Critical Fix Discovered:**
- Initial normalization script only updated 137 products
- Database had 5,223 products total - pagination issue limited to first 1,000
- Many products had incorrect brand extractions (e.g., "Royal" instead of "Royal Canin")

**Implementation:**
- Fixed pagination to process all 5,223 products
- Applied normalization to 994 products total (219 + 775)
- Fixed critical brand extraction errors:
  - Royal ‚Üí Royal Canin (97 products) 
  - Natures ‚Üí Nature's Menu (87 products)
  - Happy ‚Üí Happy Dog (63 products)
  - James ‚Üí James Wellbeloved (55 products)
  - Royal Canin Breed/Size/Care/Veterinary ‚Üí Royal Canin (102 products)
- Royal Canin now properly normalized: 253 products total
- Generated full rollback capabilities with audit trail

### 2. AADF Pipeline Enhancement ‚úÖ
Complete pipeline with improved brand extraction and matching:

**Staging Infrastructure:**
- Created `retailer_staging_aadf_v2` table with proper schema
- Enhanced brand/product extraction from URLs
- Processed 1,101 AADF products with 100% ingredient coverage
- Implemented comprehensive matching analysis

**Re-match Results After Normalization:**
- High-confidence matches: 13 (1.2%) 
- New UK products identified: 1,078 (97.9%)
- Root cause identified: Market mismatch (UK vs European focus)
- Only 17% brand overlap between AADF and canonical

### 3. Database Architecture Resolution ‚úÖ
Fixed SQL compatibility and documented structure:

**SQL Fixes:**
- Resolved PostgreSQL `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` syntax errors
- Discovered views are regular (not materialized) - no refresh needed
- Created corrected scripts: `sql/refresh_views_fixed.sql`

**Documentation:**
- Created `.claude/context/DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Explains table relationships and data flow
- Clarifies view behavior (auto-update, no refresh needed)
