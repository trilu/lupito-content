## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix size categorization logic**: 297 breeds have incorrect size categories
   - Review size calculation algorithm
   - Ensure proper mapping between weight and size categories

2. **Improve data completeness**: 35% of fields are missing
   - Focus on lifespan data (61% missing)
   - Complete weight/height data for remaining 30% of breeds

### Medium Priority
3. **Correct weight discrepancies**: 184 breeds need weight adjustments
   - Review weight extraction from Wikipedia
   - Validate against multiple sources

4. **Add missing benchmark breeds**: 2 breeds not found
   - Florida Brown Dog
   - Lài

### Low Priority
5. **Enhance data quality checks**: Implement automated validation
   - Size-weight consistency checks
   - Cross-reference with multiple data sources

## Conclusion

The Wikipedia scraping campaign successfully updated all breeds and fixed critical issues with popular breeds like Labrador Retriever. However, significant data quality issues remain, particularly with size categorization (19.1% accuracy) and data completeness (64.8%). 

The immediate priority should be fixing the size categorization logic, as this affects 81% of breeds. Once corrected, the overall quality score would improve significantly from the current D grade to potentially a B grade.

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix size categorization algorithm
2. Run targeted scraping for breeds with missing lifespan data
3. Implement data validation pipeline
4. Schedule regular quality audits
5. Consider multiple data sources for validation
