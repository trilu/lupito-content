# Retailer Scraping Summary & Recommendations

## Overview
After testing multiple European retailers for dog food product scraping, here are the findings:

## Retailers Tested

### 1. **Zooplus** ⚠️ Partially Working
- **Status**: Category pages work, product pages don't
- **Issues**: 
  - Bot protection on individual product pages
  - Returns generic "Dry Dog Food" for all product names
  - No nutrition data available via basic scraping
- **What Works**: 
  - Category pages have JSON-LD with product names and prices
  - Can get product URLs from category pages
- **Recommendation**: Use ScrapingBee or Selenium for full data

### 2. **Pets at Home** ❌ Blocked
- **Status**: Site accessible but no products found
- **Issues**: Heavy bot protection
- **Recommendation**: Requires advanced scraping tools

### 3. **Amazon UK** ✅ Best Option
- **Status**: Working for search and product listings
- **What Works**:
  - Search results accessible
  - Product listings show basic info
  - Can extract ASINs and prices
- **Issues**:
  - Nutrition data not in standard format
  - May need refined extraction patterns
- **Recommendation**: Most promising for basic scraping

### 4. **Fressnapf/Maxi Zoo** ⚠️ Limited Access
- **Status**: Site accessible but limited data
- **Issues**: 
  - German language for main site
  - Complex navigation structure
- **Recommendation**: Use MaxiZoo.ie (English version) if needed

### 5. **Other Retailers**
- **Monster Pet Supplies**: 403 Forbidden
- **VioVet**: 403 Forbidden  
- **Fetch UK**: Accessible but limited products
- **Petworld IE**: 404 on category pages

## Key Findings

### Database Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ Column name mismatch: `ingredients_raw` vs `ingredients_text`
- ✅ Missing `in_stock` column (not needed but some scripts expected it)
- ✅ Successfully saved test product to database

### Nutrition Data Challenges
Most retailers either:
1. Load nutrition via JavaScript (not in HTML)
2. Have it in images only
3. Use non-standard formats
4. Block scrapers from accessing product pages

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Use ScrapingBee API** (You already have this)
   - Can handle JavaScript rendering
   - Bypasses bot protection
   - Already configured in your project

2. **Focus on Amazon UK First**
   - Most accessible
   - Large product catalog
   - Standard URL structure
   - Has most major brands

3. **Collect from Category Pages**
   - Zooplus category pages have JSON-LD data
   - Can get product names, prices, and URLs
   - Then use ScrapingBee for individual product nutrition

### Implementation Strategy

```python
# Recommended approach:
1. Start with Amazon UK for basic product data
2. Use category pages for bulk product discovery
3. Use ScrapingBee for detailed nutrition data
4. Fall back to manual brand website scraping for missing data
```

### Next Steps

1. **Set up ScrapingBee integration** for retailers
2. **Create Amazon UK connector** with proper extraction
3. **Build nutrition data extractor** with multiple patterns
4. **Test with 20-30 products** across different brands

## Database Schema Corrections

The correct column names for `food_candidates_sc`:
- `ingredients_raw` (not `ingredients_text`)
- `retailer_price_eur` (for prices)
- `retailer_currency` (GBP, EUR, etc.)
- `protein_percent`, `fat_percent`, `fiber_percent` (nutrition)

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Database connection working
- ✅ Can save products with correct schema
- ⚠️ Nutrition extraction needs improvement
- ⚠️ Most retailers need advanced scraping tools

## Conclusion

Regular HTTP scraping has limited success due to:
- Bot protection on most sites
- JavaScript-rendered content
- Complex HTML structures

**Recommended approach**: Use ScrapingBee API or Selenium for comprehensive data extraction, starting with Amazon UK as the most accessible retailer.
